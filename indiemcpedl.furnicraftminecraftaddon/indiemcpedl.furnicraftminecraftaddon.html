<p>
This add-on adds more than 500 Furniture to the game, It also adds a simple Comes Alive. There is everything from kitchen utensils and bathroom equipment to things like a stove, shower products, and entertainment-related things like a pool table and gaming PC. It's a great addition if you want more options for decorating your home.
</p>

All the furniture are solid 3d blocks, this means you can easily rotate the furniture in any direction you want. Some furniture, like chairs and sofas, also has some functionality in that regard so that you can sit on them. Currently, all furniture can be crafted in the new Furnicraft Bench.
